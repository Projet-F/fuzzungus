# Deprecated content

This folder has been creating for sorting purposes. It contains deprecated content that is no longer used in the project, but that we want to keep for reference.

## Network Monitor

Not to be confused with the Network Monitor in the `boofuzz/monitor` folder, this is the original Network Monitor that was used by Sulley to log network traffic as `.pcap` files. It is no longer used in the project, but is kept here for reference. It is now recommended to use the Boofuzz logging system.

## Request Definitions

This was part of the old definition system. Better to use the new one now that it works correctly.
